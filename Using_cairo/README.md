# Spirographs

In the section, I used the python package pycairo to create these images/graphs. theay can be exported in ```.png``` format.

## To install package cairo:

```pip install pycairo```

Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the cairo graphics library. The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in a more 'Pythonic' way.

use ```import cairo``` to import package
