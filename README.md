# Spirographs

A Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The well known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

# About Project

In this project I have used python to create these euclidean shapes. 
Have fun playing around with the values to create more shapes.
