# Spirographs

A Spirograph is a geometric drawing toy that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. 

# About Project

In this project I have used python to create these euclidean shapes. 
Have fun playing around with the values to create more shapes.
